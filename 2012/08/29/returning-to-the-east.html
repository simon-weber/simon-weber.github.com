<p class="meta">August 29 2012</p>

<p>I spent the summer as a Google intern at their Mountain View headquarters. Having recently returned to the east, the California sun has now melted into Pennsylvania rain; it’s an anticlimactic end to an otherwise fantastic summer.</p>

<p>Google exceeded my expectations. I arrived skeptical, expecting to see their world-famous perks masking a typical BigCo™ culture - where engineers are codemonkeys, bureaucracy reigns, and nobody cares about users. I’m happy to report that this is far from the truth. While Google as a whole is definitely nothing like a startup - don’t let anyone tell you otherwise - the culture felt healthy. Googlers constantly stick up for their users, openly asking the hard questions of management.</p>

<p>Google’s also got an incredible amount of talent, which was reflected in those I worked with. My team was responsible for making Google’s call centers more efficient (yes, Google does pick up the phone, but only for paying customers). I was tasked with a webapp to provide real-time visualization of our call centers’ statuses. This allows managers to intelligently shuffle agents around to different call queues. The entire project was my responsibility: project management, frontend, backend, monitoring, deployment. . .the works. I got to play with all kinds of internal secret-sauce, and despite ballooning requirements, my team and I were really pleased with what I shipped.</p>

<p>When I wasn’t banging out code, the Google perks didn’t disappoint. Tech talks and events: held daily (one of which <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1grp9hLaYnegWN0rfkZHSfqtYmBme9vtaAoinZmIIqKI/edit">I presented</a>). The food: delicious. The booze: classy. Googlers are encouraged (expected?) to work hard and play hard. This seems to align with what I experienced at visits to other bay area companies: GitHub, Quora, LinkedIn, Stripe, Facebook, etc.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley boasts perfect weather, but the best part was the people. I hung out with a posse of interns from various tech companies. I danced in Google’s SF Pride contingent. I watched classic demoscene while discussing phreaker war stories at <a href="http://www.hackerdojo.com">Hacker Dojo</a>. I ate donut burgers with Zuck, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNdcgVTTaS8">partied</a> with PJ Hyett, and boogied with Alan Eustace.</p>

<p>No, seriously: this is Alan and me on the dance floor.</p>
</div>

<p>All these people had a common feature: real passion for their work. Being around this energy has inspired me, so - with my Google legal restrictions lifted - I’m ready to jump into my side projects again. I’ll be maintaining my <a href="https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API">Google Music api</a>, but probably won’t implement any huge new features. Instead, my time will likely be spent dogfooding it in a project to sync 3rd party media players to Google Music. I’ve already finished a <a href="https://github.com/simon-weber/Mirror-MediaMonkey-to-Google-Music">proof of concept</a>; now it’s time to buckle down and ship something. That is, if this unacceptable (read: not absolutely perfect) east coast weather doesn’t kill me first.</p>
