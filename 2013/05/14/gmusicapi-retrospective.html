<p class="meta">May 14 2013</p>

<p>gmusicapi has come a long way since I pushed my <a href="https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API/commit/880fcb3063e5ed3ba7179f1a9c8fda8c41f1dd6a">first commit</a> back in January 2012.</p>

<p>The project has grown more than usual during this semester, since – for the first time – I worked on it for school credit.
Here’s what I spent my time on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a number of big features: scan-and-match support, album art operations, Music Manager OAuth support, python 2.6 compatibility. . .</li>
  <li>a new dynamic testing system for my end-to-end tests</li>
  <li>a huge rewrite to allow for more flexible protocol declarations</li>
  <li>continuous integration that also catches protocol changes</li>
  <li>documentation improvements and a new irc support channel</li>
  <li>version 1.0!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API/graphs">Github’s graphs</a> provide a quick overview of what I’ve been up to.
Here are a few other metrics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>documentation visits x5, bounce rate halved</li>
  <li>PyPi download rate x2</li>
  <li>use in a couple of real-world products</li>
</ul>

<p>I figure this is a good chance to reflect on some of the decisions I’ve made, both for my sake and for those who might come this way in the future.</p>

<h3 id="dont-count-out-end-to-end-testing">Don’t count out end-to-end testing</h3>

<p>I have a few unit tests, but the majority of my tests are end-to-end black-box tests that exercise my clients against actual Google servers.
Naturally, they violate core unit test principles: they’re stateful, cannot be run offline, and run slowly.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve learned while coming to this solution: there’s a lot of dogma surrounding test strategies.</p>

<p>It’s not that I’m against unit testing.
I’d love to have more unit tests!
Unfortunately, writing them isn’t free, and in my case, end-to-end tests offer more bang for my buck.
I get more coverage with less code and get to test my expectations about Google’s servers.
gmusicapi is also pretty small, so the loss of granularity when bug-hunting isn’t a huge deal.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s some extra work required to make your end-to-end tests robust.
Backend flakiness can be addressed with retry and backoff.
Test dependence and state management can be handled with TestNG-like frameworks (I use <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/proboscis/">Proboscis</a>).
Protocol changes can be caught by validating responses against a schema.</p>

<p>Currently, I have a few Google accounts I use exclusively for testing, and I keep their credentials in TravisCI encrypted variables.
There’s one big downside to this: encrypted variables can’t be used with other folks’ pull requests.
In the future, I hope to figure out a way to safely manage a public test account (I think it’s possible with 2-factor auth).</p>

<h3 id="invest-in-support">Invest in support</h3>

<p>I have trouble saying no to requests for help.
Interestingly, gmusicapi also seems to attract many users who are new to Python.
Because of these factors, I used to spend a fair amount of time answering support emails.
I didn’t mind this, but after receiving a few emails on the same topics, I figured it’d be better to flesh out the <a href="http://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.org">gmusicapi documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Basic questions were addressed with installation and getting starting sections.
These were no-brainers, and I should have added them earlier.</p>

<p>I also added a section for a less obvious topic: people want the reverse-engineered protocols I’m using.
So far, I’ve thrown together a hack that introspects my protocol declaration code, but I’ve got plenty of room to improve this.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=gmusicapi">#gmusicapi irc channel on Freenode</a> is another recent support addition.
I wish I’d set it up earlier!
Recently, devs building on gmusicapi have started hanging out and answering questions, which has been a huge help.</p>

<p>I still go the extra mile when I do direct support.
Helping users out is its own reward, but I’m also flattered to have received thank-you emails after irc chats, money, and – once – even a gift in the mail!</p>

<h3 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h3>

<p>I’m very pleased with what I’ve learned and accomplished so far.
My next step is to get the project into a self-sustaining state.
I figure this means knocking out todos, beefing up internal documentation, and refactoring all of the wonky bits that have accumulated over time.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I’ll have plenty of time this summer at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>!</p>
