<p class="meta">June 5 2013, updated March 18 2017</p>

<p><em>If you’re selling an extension, check out my project <a href="https://analytics.simon.codes">Analytics for Google Payments</a>.</em></p>

<p>I just shipped my first Recurse Center project: a Chrome extension that scratches a personal itch.
I use <a href="http://turntable.fm">turntable.fm</a> every now and then, which lets me dj music with friends.
There, I can search for a song, and if someone has previously uploaded it, queue it up for everyone to hear.
If turntable doesn’t have a song, I can upload a file from my computer.</p>

<p>However, I don’t normally have music files on my laptop; my library is kept in Google Music.
So, if turntable was missing a song, I used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open Google Music and sign in</li>
  <li>find and download the song</li>
  <li>switch to turntable and upload it</li>
  <li>delete the file</li>
</ul>

<p>My extension lets me do this right in turntable.
Now, all I do is click “Upload from Google Music”, find the song and hit upload.
The extension does the same thing behind the scenes.</p>

<p>If this sounds useful, you can get it here: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/turntable-uploader-for-go/akchbpaepakjnaihbgkdgjjgpdcckapb">Turntable Uploader for Google Music™</a>.
But, this blog post isn’t about advertising: I wanted to document all the weird hacks that went into making this work.
If you’re already a Chrome extension guru, you may already know this stuff;
it’s intended as a post I would have wanted before writing a line of code.</p>

<p>First, a brief intro to Chrome extensions.
If you’ve written one before, you can probably skip this part.</p>

<h3 id="intro-to-chrome-extensions">Intro to Chrome extensions</h3>

<p>Chrome extensions are just normal javascript and html, but with optional extra permissions.
For example, cross domain requests and cookie access are kosher – you just need the user to approve them.</p>

<p>Your extension can be made up of two different kinds of scripts.
The first is the <em>background script</em> (or <em>event script</em>; the same thing but not always running).
This does the heavy lifting, since it gets access to special <code class="highlighter-rouge">chrome.*</code> apis.
These enable stuff like the cookie access I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>You can also run a bunch of <em>content scripts</em>.
Unlike the background script, these are specific to a certain page.
They get triggered when a tab matches a url pattern you specify (eg <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://turntable.com/*</code>).
They don’t get <code class="highlighter-rouge">chrome.*</code> access.
They can access the DOM, but run in an <em>isolated world</em> –
basically, they can modify the DOM, but can’t mess with other code running on the page.
For example, my content script can’t remove an event handler that a turntable script has set up.</p>

<p>At a first glance, content scripts sound pretty limited.
However, you can get around all of the restrictions above with a bit of hackery.
To access <code class="highlighter-rouge">chrome.*</code> apis, there’s a two-way messaging interface to the background script:
you just offload the work there.
Anything json-encodable is fair game for transport.
Even the isolated world isn’t bulletproof: with DOM access, you can inject a script tag to get at the global namespace.</p>

<p>My extension uses all three pieces mentioned above: background, content, and injected scripts.
All together, they communicate like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">our background script
     ^
     |
     |
   <span class="o">(</span>chrome message passing<span class="o">)</span>
     |
     v
our content script
     ^
     |
     |
   <span class="o">(</span>the dom<span class="o">)</span>
     |
     v
our injected code
     |
     |
   <span class="o">(</span>global namespace<span class="o">)</span>
     |
     v
other code on the page</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we know what we have to work with, I’ll go over how I addressed each of the big pieces of my solution.</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-google-music-library-and-downloading-songs">Getting the Google Music library and downloading songs</h3>

<p>I’ve spent far too much time with the Google Music protocol from my work on <a href="http://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API">gmusicapi</a>, so I already knew which endpoints to hit.</p>

<p>Auth presented a hurdle, though, since it requires either plaintext credentials (yuck) or OAuth (annoying).
I got around this with my extra Chrome host and cookies permissions:
I just have the user open Google Music in another tab, then piggyback on that session.
My requests will automatically send Google cookies, and I just have to grab an xsrf cookie for use in the url.</p>

<h3 id="uploading-to-turntable">Uploading to turntable</h3>

<p>This was the toughest nut to crack.
I considered reverse engineering the endpoints that turntable’s client page used for uploading, but this had a number of disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the user wouldn’t see the upload in the turntable interface</li>
  <li>I don’t have the javascript chops to implement a complicated upload protocol</li>
  <li>future protocol changes would break stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>A better approach: tricking turntable’s own clientside code into believing the user had initiated a normal upload.
This makes turntable do all the work, and is business as usual for the user.</p>

<p>After some quality time in the DevTools debugger, a friend of mine (thanks, <a href="https://github.com/clehner">Charlie</a>!) figured out a way to do this.
turntable uses a third party library called <a href="http://plupload.com">plupload</a>.
Unfortunately, a high level <code class="highlighter-rouge">window.plupload.upload(File)</code> function isn’t accessible; it’s hidden inside turntable closures.
However, a similar function is stored directly as a handler on the main file input, meaning that we can spoof an upload with something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">$('..input[file]..').onchange.call(our_File)</code>.</p>

<p>Since injected code gets around the isolated world restriction, this is totally possible:
we just need to also inject an html5 File containing the desired mp3.</p>

<h3 id="getting-a-file-from-a-blob">Getting a File from a Blob</h3>

<p>Html5 Blobs are easy to create, and just represent binary data.
Html5 Files, though, can only be created when a user interacts with a file input (here’s the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/">File api docs</a>, if you want the details).</p>

<p>Luckily, Files aren’t much different from Blobs: they just add a filename and date of modification.
Duck typing to the rescue!</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">//b is our Blob</span>
<span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'myfile.mp3'</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">lastModifiedDate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Date</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="c1">// tada!</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Those are the main hacks. Combining everything, this is about what happens when an upload is requested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>content script messages the background script with a file id to upload</li>
  <li>background script performs a cross domain request to Google and retrieves a Blob</li>
  <li>background script encodes the Blob as a base64 dataurl</li>
  <li>Blob dataurl (now json-compatible) is messaged back to the content script</li>
  <li>content script injects the entire dataurl, along with code to do the Blob to File spoofing, trigger the plupload code, and clean up when done</li>
</ul>

<p>From there, I just added a bunch of messaging to get the ui working and a third party library to display the Google Music library.
You can grab my ugly code on <a href="https://github.com/simon-weber/Google-Music-Turntable-Uploader">my GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to write continue writing posts like these during my time at the Recurse Center, so if you dug this, Twitter or RSS are the best ways to get more.</p>

<p>Many thanks to my fellow Recursers who read over this post: <a href="http://lfranchi.com">Leo Franchi</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eriktaubeneck">Erik Taubeneck</a>.</p>
