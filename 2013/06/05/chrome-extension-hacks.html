    <h2 id='chrome_extension_hacks_google_music_to_turntable'>Chrome extension hacks: Google Music to turntable</h2>
<p class='meta'>June 5 2013</p>
<p>I just shipped my first Hacker School project: a Chrome extension that scratches a personal itch. I use <a href='http://turntable.fm'>turntable.fm</a> every now and then, which lets me dj music with friends. There, I can search for a song, and if someone has previously uploaded it, queue it up for everyone to hear. If turntable doesn&#8217;t have a song, I can upload a file from my computer.</p>

<p>However, I don&#8217;t normally have music files on my laptop; my library is kept in Google Music. So, if turntable was missing a song, I used to:</p>

<ul>
<li>open Google Music and sign in</li>

<li>find and download the song</li>

<li>switch to turntable and upload it</li>

<li>delete the file</li>
</ul>

<p>My extension lets me do this right in turntable. Now, all I do is click “Upload from Google Music”, find the song and hit upload. The extension does the same thing behind the scenes.</p>

<p>If this sounds useful, you can get it here: <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/turntable-uploader-for-go/akchbpaepakjnaihbgkdgjjgpdcckapb'>Turntable Uploader for Google Music™</a>. But, this blog post isn&#8217;t about advertising: I wanted to document all the weird hacks that went into making this work. If you&#8217;re already a Chrome extension guru, you may already know this stuff; it&#8217;s intended as a post I would have wanted before writing a line of code.</p>

<p>First, a brief intro to Chrome extensions. If you&#8217;ve written one before, you can probably skip this part.</p>

<h3 id='intro_to_chrome_extensions'>Intro to Chrome extensions</h3>

<p>Chrome extensions are just normal javascript and html, but with optional extra permissions. For example, cross domain requests and cookie access are kosher &#8211; you just need the user to approve them.</p>

<p>Your extension can be made up of two different kinds of scripts. The first is the <em>background script</em> (or <em>event script</em>; the same thing but not always running). This does the heavy lifting, since it gets access to special <code>chrome.*</code> apis. These enable stuff like the cookie access I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>You can also run a bunch of <em>content scripts</em>. Unlike the background script, these are specific to a certain page. They get triggered when a tab matches a url pattern you specify (eg <code>http://turntable.com/*</code>). They don&#8217;t get <code>chrome.*</code> access. They can access the DOM, but run in an <em>isolated world</em> &#8211; basically, they can modify the DOM, but can&#8217;t mess with other code running on the page. For example, my content script can&#8217;t remove an event handler that a turntable script has set up.</p>

<p>At a first glance, content scripts sound pretty limited. However, you can get around all of the restrictions above with a bit of hackery. To access <code>chrome.*</code> apis, there&#8217;s a two-way messaging interface to the background script: you just offload the work there. Anything json-encodable is fair game for transport. Even the isolated world isn&#8217;t bulletproof: with DOM access, you can inject a script tag to get at the global namespace.</p>

<p>My extension uses all three pieces mentioned above: background, content, and injected scripts. All together, they communicate like this:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>our background script
     ^
     |
     |
   <span class='o'>(</span>chrome message passing<span class='o'>)</span>
     |
     v
our content script
     ^
     |
     |
   <span class='o'>(</span>the dom<span class='o'>)</span>
     |
     v
our injected code
     |
     |
   <span class='o'>(</span>global namespace<span class='o'>)</span>
     |
     v
other code on the page
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we know what we have to work with, I&#8217;ll go over how I addressed each of the big pieces of my solution.</p>

<h3 id='getting_the_google_music_library_and_downloading_songs'>Getting the Google Music library and downloading songs</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent far too much time with the Google Music protocol from my work on <a href='http://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API'>gmusicapi</a>, so I already knew which endpoints to hit.</p>

<p>Auth presented a hurdle, though, since it requires either plaintext credentials (yuck) or OAuth (annoying). I got around this with my extra Chrome host and cookies permissions: I just have the user open Google Music in another tab, then piggyback on that session. My requests will automatically send Google cookies, and I just have to grab an xsrf cookie for use in the url.</p>

<h3 id='uploading_to_turntable'>Uploading to turntable</h3>

<p>This was the toughest nut to crack. I considered reverse engineering the endpoints that turntable&#8217;s client page used for uploading, but this had a number of disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>the user wouldn&#8217;t see the upload in the turntable interface</li>

<li>I don&#8217;t have the javascript chops to implement a complicated upload protocol</li>

<li>future protocol changes would break stuff</li>
</ul>

<p>A better approach: tricking turntable&#8217;s own clientside code into believing the user had initiated a normal upload. This makes turntable do all the work, and is business as usual for the user.</p>

<p>After some quality time in the DevTools debugger, a friend of mine (thanks, <a href='https://github.com/clehner'>Charlie</a>!) figured out a way to do this. turntable uses a third party library called <a href='http://plupload.com'>plupload</a>. Unfortunately, a high level <code>window.plupload.upload(File)</code> function isn&#8217;t accessible; it&#8217;s hidden inside turntable closures. However, a similar function is stored directly as a handler on the main file input, meaning that we can spoof an upload with something like <code>$(&#39;..input[file]..&#39;).onchange.call(our_File)</code>.</p>

<p>Since injected code gets around the isolated world restriction, this is totally possible: we just need to also inject an html5 File containing the desired mp3.</p>

<h3 id='getting_a_file_from_a_blob'>Getting a File from a Blob</h3>

<p>Html5 Blobs are easy to create, and just represent binary data. Html5 Files, though, can only be created when a user interacts with a file input (here&#8217;s the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/'>File api docs</a>, if you want the details).</p>

<p>Luckily, Files aren&#8217;t much different from Blobs: they just add a filename and date of modification. Duck typing to the rescue!</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='c1'>//b is our Blob</span>
<span class='nx'>b</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>name</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;myfile.mp3&#39;</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='nx'>b</span><span class='p'>.</span><span class='nx'>lastModifiedDate</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>new</span> <span class='nb'>Date</span><span class='p'>();</span>
<span class='c1'>// tada!</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id='putting_it_all_together'>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Those are the main hacks. Combining everything, this is about what happens when an upload is requested:</p>

<ul>
<li>content script messages the background script with a file id to upload</li>

<li>background script performs a cross domain request to Google and retrieves a Blob</li>

<li>background script encodes the Blob as a base64 dataurl</li>

<li>Blob dataurl (now json-compatible) is messaged back to the content script</li>

<li>content script injects the entire dataurl, along with code to do the Blob to File spoofing, trigger the plupload code, and clean up when done</li>
</ul>

<p>From there, I just added a bunch of messaging to get the ui working and a third party library to display the Google Music library. You can grab my ugly code on <a href='https://github.com/simon-weber/Google-Music-Turntable-Uploader'>my GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to write continue writing posts like these during my time at Hacker School, so if you dug this, Twitter or RSS are the best ways to get more.</p>

<p>Many thanks to my fellow Hacker Schoolers who read over this post: <a href='http://lfranchi.com'>Leo Franchi</a> and <a href='https://github.com/eriktaubeneck'>Erik Taubeneck</a>.</p>
