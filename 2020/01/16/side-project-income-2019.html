<p class="meta">January 15 2020</p>

<p>2019 was my fourth year running my own small software business.
I also <a href="/2019/04/26/leaving-venmo-after-five-years.html">quit my job</a> in the spring!
I’m now self-employed but spend most of my time consulting, so I still consider the business to be “on the side”.
Here’s my active projects as of the end of the year:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://autoplaylists.simon.codes/">Autoplaylists for Google Music</a>: iTunes Smart Playlists for Google Music.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gchat.simon.codes/">Autoresponder for Google Hangouts</a>: vacation/out-of-office replies for Google Chat.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.kleroteria.org/">Kleroteria</a>: an email lottery and spiritual successor to The Listserve.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.repominder.com/">Repominder</a>: release reminders for open source projects.</li>
  <li><a href="https://parks.simon.codes/">NYC Park Alerts</a>:  closure notifications about NYC Parks locations.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.plugserv.com/">Plugserv</a>: an ad server for my own projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="financials">Financials</h3>

<p>This was my first down year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>annual revenue decreased from $3600 to $3330</li>
  <li>annual expenses grew slightly from $240 to $280</li>
  <li>monthly recurring revenue dropped substantially from $350 to $250</li>
</ul>

<p>Autoplaylists and Autoresponder - which make up nearly all my revenue - both extend Google products that are being shut down, so I had actually expected more of a decline.
While I <a href="/2019/01/07/side-project-income-2018.html">began diversifying in 2018</a>, those efforts haven’t yet impacted the bottom line.</p>

<h3 id="new-projects">New Projects</h3>

<p>I added two smaller projects last year.
NYC Park Alerts was inspired by my gym habits, of all things.
I work out at a local rec center and showed up a few times to find it unexpectedly closed.
Looking into it, I found that the city posts updates online but with no way to subscribe to them.
So, I set up a scraper that lets people receive emails when locations of their choice are affected.
It’s got one user (besides me) and is more of a community service, so I don’t expect to ever make money off it.</p>

<p>
My second new project was Plugserv.
It's a tiny ad server that helps me shamelessly plug my projects across my own sites.
Here's a live example of what it looks like: "<span id="example-plug"></span>"
Behind the scenes that copy is being retrieved from the Plugserv api, which handles rotation and tracking.
It's performed better than I expected: in the six months it's been active it's served ~25k ads with a click through rate of over 1%, which beats most display ad benchmarks.
Despite working well for me it hasn't picked up any other users; go <a href="https://www.plugserv.com/">check it out</a> if you'd like to run your own ads on your own sites!
</p>

<h3 id="existing-projects">Existing Projects</h3>

<p>2019 was also the first year I stopped running any projects.
I’m usually content to let projects run despite low usage because my expenses are so low.
But, I made an exception for Analytics for Google Payments:
despite being free to run and having potential with business customers, it was painful to maintain and targeted a much smaller market than I expected.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.minmaxmeals.com/">MinMaxMeals</a>, my cooking site, was more of a case of lost interest.
Its recipes were heavily optimized for time, which isn’t as important to me now that I’m self-employed and work from home.
It’s still a fun talking point, though, and I might return to it someday.</p>

<p>My remaining projects both grew slowly without my involvement.
Repominder picked up a notable open source power user and Kleroteria added about 500 subscribers.</p>

<p>Though I didn’t do much marketing or feature work, I did spend some time on operational improvements.
I consolidated my sundry virtual servers into a fleet of $2/month instances at <a href="https://my.frantech.ca/aff.php?aff=3397">BuyVM</a>.
Each runs a new NixOS+docker setup that’s generic enough to be cloned for new projects.
I also upgraded everything to Python 3 and worked out a better way to route my custom-domain emails into Gmail for cheap (which I’ll write up eventually).</p>

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>

<p>2019 had its ups and downs, but now that I’m settled into my new lifestyle I’m feeling ready for 2020.
I don’t expect it to be easy, though: Autoplaylists and Autoresponder are likely to shut down completely, and there’s a real chance I’ll find myself in the red.</p>

<p>So, hopefully my upcoming projects can prevent this.
One of these - hosted server/application monitoring with unusually low operating costs - should launch soon, so sign up below if you’d like to get notified about it!</p>

<p>As always, thanks for following along and feel free to reach out with questions.
