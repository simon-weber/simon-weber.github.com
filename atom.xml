&lt;h2 id='whats_in_a_genre'&gt;What&amp;#8217;s in a genre?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class='meta'&gt;September 07 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m taking a course on data mining this semester. Our first assignment: mine some data. The dataset and techniques don&amp;#8217;t matter; the point is to extract meaning in any way possible. I&amp;#8217;m greenhorn data miner; hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll be able to look back at this post and laugh at my own naivete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my dataset I chose my own Google Music library. It&amp;#8217;s unique, big enough (7600+ songs), and well organized. Plus, it&amp;#8217;s a cinch to access with my &lt;a href='https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API'&gt;Google Music api&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My analysis was simple: I investigated the occurrences of words in genres. I figured the most frequent words would be genres themselves (eg &amp;#8216;metal&amp;#8217; in &amp;#8216;power metal&amp;#8217;), but there was also the chance of exposing common adjectives (eg &amp;#8216;post&amp;#8217; in &amp;#8216;post-rock&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;post-metal&amp;#8217;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few lines of Python later, and I had my results. The first thing I noticed: I listen to a lot of metal. A third of my songs are some kind of metal. If you put all the genre words into a hat, you&amp;#8217;d pick &amp;#8216;metal&amp;#8217; almost a quarter of the time. Next up: &amp;#8216;rock&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;jazz&amp;#8217;. Rounding out the top six are two adjectives - &amp;#8216;alternative&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;progressive&amp;#8217; - as well as &amp;#8216;accompaniment&amp;#8217; (as in &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamey_Aebersold'&gt;Jamey Aebersold&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metal bands also claim the longest genres in my library. &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novembre_(band)'&gt;Novembre&lt;/a&gt; is the champion, boasting this mouthful: &amp;#8216;Progressive atmospheric doom metal&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;#8217;ve figured out I&amp;#8217;m a jazz-playing metalhead, let&amp;#8217;s take a look at the least common words. &amp;#8216;Country&amp;#8217; appears only once (and at the risk of sounding one-sided, it labels the fantastic &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughter_of_the_bluegrass'&gt;Slaughter of the Bluegrass&lt;/a&gt;). There&amp;#8217;s a bunch of mispellings, too, like &amp;#8216;reggaer&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;sountrack&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a quick chart of all the words I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='eleven columns' id='words_chart' style='height: 400px;'&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assignment turned out to be a surprising amount of fun. For any other music lovers who want to take a dive into their libraries, I&amp;#8217;ve got the &lt;a href='https://github.com/simon-weber/Google-Music-genre-analysis'&gt;source on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Returning to the East</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id='returning_to_the_east'&gt;Returning to the East&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class='meta'&gt;August 29 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the summer as a Google intern at their Mountain View headquarters. Having recently returned to the east, the California sun has now melted into Pennsylvania rain; it’s an anticlimactic end to an otherwise fantastic summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google exceeded my expectations. I arrived skeptical, expecting to see their world-famous perks masking a typical BigCo™ culture - where engineers are codemonkeys, bureaucracy reigns, and nobody cares about users. I’m happy to report that this is far from the truth. While Google as a whole is definitely nothing like a startup - don’t let anyone tell you otherwise - the culture felt healthy. Googlers constantly stick up for their users, openly asking the hard questions of management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google’s also got an incredible amount of talent, which was reflected in those I worked with. My team was responsible for making Google’s call centers more efficient (yes, Google does pick up the phone, but only for paying customers). I was tasked with a webapp to provide real-time visualization of our call centers’ statuses. This allows managers to intelligently shuffle agents around to different call queues. The entire project was my responsibility: project management, frontend, backend, monitoring, deployment&amp;#8230;the works. I got to play with all kinds of internal secret-sauce, and despite ballooning requirements, my team and I were really pleased with what I shipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I wasn’t banging out code, the Google perks didn’t disappoint. Tech talks and events: held daily (one of which &lt;a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1grp9hLaYnegWN0rfkZHSfqtYmBme9vtaAoinZmIIqKI/edit'&gt;I presented&lt;/a&gt;). The food: delicious. The booze: classy. Googlers are encouraged (expected?) to work hard and play hard. This seems to align with what I experienced at visits to other bay area companies: GitHub, Quora, LinkedIn, Stripe, Facebook, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley boasts perfect weather, but the best part was the people. I hung out with a posse of interns from various tech companies. I danced in Google’s SF Pride contingent. I watched classic demoscene while discussing phreaker war stories at &lt;a href='http://www.hackerdojo.com'&gt;Hacker Dojo&lt;/a&gt;. I ate donut burgers with Zuck, &lt;a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNdcgVTTaS8'&gt;partied&lt;/a&gt; with PJ Hyett, and boogied with Alan Eustace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='figure'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='Alan Eustace and Simon Weber dancing' src='/images/alan_eustace_dancing.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, seriously: this is Alan and me on the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these people had a common feature: real passion for their work. Being around this energy has inspired me, so - with my Google legal restrictions lifted - I’m ready to jump into my side projects again. I’ll be maintaining my &lt;a href='https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API'&gt;Google Music api&lt;/a&gt;, but probably won’t implement any huge new features. Instead, my time will likely be spent dogfooding it in a project to sync 3rd party media players to Google Music. I’ve already finished a &lt;a href='https://github.com/simon-weber/Mirror-MediaMonkey-to-Google-Music'&gt;proof of concept&lt;/a&gt;; now it’s time to buckle down and ship something. That is, if this unacceptable (read: not absolutely perfect) east coast weather doesn’t kill me first.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Cold-email a VP, Publish in Phrack</title>
   <link href="http://www.simonmweber.com/2012/04/14/email-vps-and-publish-in-phrack.html"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id='coldemail_a_vp_publish_in_phrack'&gt;Cold-email a VP, Publish in Phrack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class='meta'&gt;14 April 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the popular sense of the word, I&amp;#8217;m no super-hacker. While coding, my sunglasses and fingerless gloves stay on the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='figure'&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='Acid Burn (Hackers 1995) in a trench coat' src='/images/hackers-trenchcoat.jpg' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My collection of sexy trenchcoats is also lacking. (&lt;a href='http://www.news.com.au/technology/gallery-e6frflwi-1225878429415?page=3'&gt;credit&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these disadvantages, back in September I discovered a &lt;a href='https://github.com/simon-weber/XSS-over-NBNS'&gt;vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in the web interface of a Netgear wireless router. Now &lt;a href='http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=68&amp;amp;id=4#article'&gt;published in Phrack&lt;/a&gt;, my exploit code allowed for nasty things like stealing admin credentials and hiding network devices. I wanted to let Netgear know, so I wrote my first disclosure: a friendly email briefly describing myself, the flaw, and my intentions of publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that was the easy part. A Netgear security email was nowhere to be found. In fact, I couldn’t even find a way to submit a support ticket (this has since changed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could just get my message to a human, I figured it would end up in the right place. After all, who wants to be responsible for blowing off a security flaw? On Netgear’s contact page, I found a press relations email. No response. Investor relations channel? Nope (I must not be rich enough). Support emails found by Googling? Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This obviously wasn’t going to work. It was time to pivot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten more minutes of searching got me everything I needed: the direct emails of five random support staff, plus the most executive position I could muster: the VP of engineering. Brazenly dumping them all in the recipient box, I tried again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within 10 minutes, one of the support staff got back to me, eagerly CC&amp;#8217;ing his boss&amp;#8217;s boss. I apologized, and my ensuing communication with Netgear was pleasant and to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My takeaway: it’s easier to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission. Well, that, and don’t let a lack of fingerless gloves keep you from submitting to Phrack.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
