## I'm not the author of Coding for Kids or Python Programming for Kids.


I haven't published any books;
the author is either another programmer named Simon Weber or somebody using my name to boost sales.
So, please don't send me inquiries about the books.

That said, if you are able to get in touch with the author please let me know!
I'd like to clear up the confusion but they don't provide any information about themselves.
