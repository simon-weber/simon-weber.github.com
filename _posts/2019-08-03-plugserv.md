I've been creating websites for a while now.
Some of these get consistent visitors, while some are nearly unknown.
At some point I realized there was an opportunity here: my popular sites could advertise my other sites.
So, I started manually adding small text ads to each.

This quickly became unwieldy.
I'm closing in on ten active projects, and I got sick of updating all of them whenever I launched something new.
I decided my next project would solve this problem.

I call it [Plugserv](https://www.plugserv.com/), since it lets me shamelessly plug my websites.
It's an open source ad server: I configure it with all my ads and add a javascript snippet to each site.
Plugserv then rotates my ads automatically and collects basic performance metrics.
Here's a live example of what this looks like:

<div id="plugserv-example">
<p style="text-align: center">
    <span id="example-plug"></span>
</p>

<script>
  window.plugserv_config = {
      elementId: 'example-plug',
      endpoint: 'https://www.plugserv.com/serve/eb7e777e-9ec5-4323-acba-4e05f881cf42'
  };
</script>
