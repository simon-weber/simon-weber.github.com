Autoplaylists - called "smart playlists" in iTunes - allow you to create playlists that always contain songs matching some set of rules.
For example, you could create a playlist that contains only music you haven't listened to recently, or your most-played songs of a certain genre.

They're one of my favorite ways to listen to music, but have never been available in [Google Music](https://play.google.com/music/listen).
So, I've created a Chrome Extension to add them.
Here's an example of one of my autoplaylists:

<div class="figure">
<p>
<a href="https://autoplaylists.simon.codes">
<img src="/images/autoplaylists-screenshot.jpg" alt="A screenshot of Autoplaylists for Google Music showing declaration of an autoplaylist.">
</a>
</p>
</div>

If this is something you've also found Google Music lacking, you can download it at [https://autoplaylists.simon.codes](https://autoplaylists.simon.codes).
There's a free version limited to one playlist, and a paid version supporting unlimited playlists.

The code is also open source, and can be found at [https://github.com/simon-weber/Autoplaylists-for-Google-Music](https://github.com/simon-weber/Autoplaylists-for-Google-Music).
Check it out and let me know what you think!
