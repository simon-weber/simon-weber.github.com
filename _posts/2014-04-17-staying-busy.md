I've been with Venmo for about six months now, and everything has been great!
I've worked on all sorts of things - security fixes, features and performance improvements among them -
but my main concern has been our test suite.

When I first showed up, our builds were flaky and took nearly an hour to run.
Now they're much more stable and run in five minutes.
I've got some Venmo blog posts in the works about how we acheived this
(which I'll be sure to cross-post or link here).

This work has been fulfilling, so my personal projects have been a bit neglected.
However, I've been open-sourcing a lot of Venmo code lately:

* [Thomas Boyt](http://www.thomasboyt.com) and I [added Venmo to Gittip](https://github.com/gittip/www.gittip.com/pull/1857)
* A few of us wrote [btnamespace](https://github.com/venmo/btnamespace),
  a library to make Braintree integration testing easier
* I'm about to release [a nose plugin to detect unmocked integration tests](https://gist.github.com/simon-weber/b0683e27285dc9ec8efa)

I've got some more detailed updates in the works -- stay tuned!
