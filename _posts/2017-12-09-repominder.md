I maintain a number of open source projects.
Too often, something like this would happen:

* I merge a pull request
* I promptly forget about it
* weeks later, the changes haven't reached a package registry

So, I made [Repominder](https://www.repominder.com) to help OSS maintainers avoid this situation.
Now when I forget about changes, I get a weekly email with diffs of affected projects.
It also provides a badge showing the status of my projects ([eg](https://github.com/simon-weber/Autoplaylists-for-Google-Music/#autoplaylists-for-google-music)).

Feel free to [sign up and monitor your own projects](https://www.repominder.com)!
It's [open source](https://github.com/simon-weber/repominder), and likely to remain free unless hosting becomes annoying.
