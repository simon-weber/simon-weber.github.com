In a departure from my typical projects, I've launched a cooking site!
[MinMaxMeals](https://www.minmaxmeals.com/) disregards culinary convention in favor of cost, health, and speed
-- typical meals call for $1 of ingredients and a few minutes in a microwave.

Here's a bit on its origins from [the about page](https://www.minmaxmeals.com/about/):

> While today I cook this way because it’s practical, it was originally out of necessity.
> I had suddenly become ill, and was put on a restricted diet to figure out what foods I could tolerate.
> Prepping all my own meals lead to my focus on speed, cost, and nutrition, while the limited ingredients ruled out most familiar dishes.
> As my health returned I added more ingredients, and later - after my cooking became a conversation starter - I decided to share what I’d learned.

If this sounds intriguing, check out my recipe for [oatmeal that tastes like garlic bread](https://www.minmaxmeals.com/recipes/garlic-oatmeal/).
Or, read about [the different types of lentils](https://www.minmaxmeals.com/ingredients/lentils/) and how they're often cheaper under different names.
