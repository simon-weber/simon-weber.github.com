Do you have Google accounts that forward email?
If you never log into them, you might be missing Chat/Talk/Hangouts messages.

After missing an important message, I made [https://gchat.simon.codes](https://gchat.simon.codes).
It automatically replies to - and optionally forwards - the messages you'd otherwise miss.
Check it out and let me know what you think; it's free and open source!
