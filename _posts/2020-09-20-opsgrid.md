I've built up a number of [side projects](https://simon.codes/2020/01/16/side-project-income-2019.html) over the years.
The ones that require a backend are hosted on individual vms from [BuyVM](https://my.frantech.ca/aff.php?aff=3397), which means I need to monitor about a half-dozen servers.

While there's plenty of free Pingdom-style uptime monitoring options out there, cheap options to monitor metrics like cpu, ram, and disk are more rare.
The big names usually have a free tier allowing one or two hosts with minimal data retention, then a big jump to a $10+/month per host paid tier.
I can't justify spending that when I only pay $2/month for the vms themselves!
There's also some smaller independent options out there, but they tend to require custom server agents and aren't all that much cheaper.
So, I decided to build my own.

I didn't need anything fancy, just support for the usual metrics, user-defined alerting, and, ideally, reasonable retention of past data so I could identify trends.
Like my other projects, it also needed to be operationally simple.

[Opsgrid](https://www.opsgrid.net/) is the result.
It allows free server/application alerting with about 1 year of data retention per host.
The trick is that Opsgrid doesn't actually store historical metrics: instead, users connect a Google account, and it pushes data as rows to a Google Sheet per host.
It also makes use of [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf), an open-source monitoring agent, to avoid dealing with metric collection code.

[Check it out](https://www.opsgrid.net/) if you also run your own servers!
I plan to keep it free unless it attracts a significant number of users, but even then I should be able to price it about 5-10x lower than offerings like New Relic or Datadog.
