In early 2018 I sent out a user survey for [Autoplaylists for Google Music](https://autoplaylists.simon.codes).
My goal was to get a general idea of user satisfaction, as well as figure out what I should focus on next.
Here's a quick summary of the results:

* ~30% response rate from mailing list, representing ~5% of daily actives
* ~6:4 representation of free vs paying users
* on average, users were likely to recommend it (NPS of 15)
* on average, users found it reliable (4+ on 5-point scale of "never works" to "almost always works")
* common themes in feedback were:
  * syncing is opaque
  * complex autoplaylist definitions are difficult to manage

I don't want to read too much into this - especially with a low response rate and over-representation of paying users - but in general I'm pleased with the results.
The reliability data is particularly relieving, since I had my doubts going by my user support work.

I'm hoping to address both the common pain points this year by:

* adding a syncing dashboard with past syncs and their results
* adding a way to share common parts of playlists definitions

So, here's to a successful 2018!
I'm excited to run a similar survey next year now that I have results to compare against.
