I work out at a city [rec center](https://www.nycgovparks.org/facilities/recreationcenters), largely because the price - about $10/month - is hard to beat.

Schedule consistency is a downside, however.
Due to events and maintenance I've sometimes shown up to find my location unexpectedly closed.

After some research, I found that the city does a pretty good job of [posting schedule changes online](https://www.nycgovparks.org/news/notices).
But, since there's no way to subscribe to them, you need to check every time before visiting.

So, I built [NYC Park Alerts](https://parks.simon.codes/).
It lets you subscribe to locations of your choice, and will email you when updates are posted.
Go sign up at [parks.simon.codes](https://parks.simon.codes/) if you're also a rec center fan!
